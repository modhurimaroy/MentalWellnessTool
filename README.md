# MentalWellnessTool

# Purpose of the project

This project was made for the Hack This Fall Virtual Hackathon. In it, we are creating a simple tool that allows a user to journal their feelings. The app responds to the entry with what emotion the user is experiencing as well as recommendations, and works through a worksheet that you would find assigned by a therapist. In our research, we found the following article that included a worksheet: https://positivepsychology.com/express-feelings/#worksheets

As a result of the limited time, we chose to use the model in the following github repo: https://github.com/SannketNikam/Emotion-Detection-in-Text. Existing APIs for sentiment analysis give outputs that are too vague, as they only categorize text as 'negative', 'neutral', or 'positive'. We felt it would be more useful if the user was more informed on what possible emotion that is.
